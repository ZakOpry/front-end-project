        <p>Tabs, short for "Guitar Tablature", is a method of notating music specifically for guitars in lue of traditional sheet music. 
            Tabs are easy to understand especially for beginners with no prior sheet music experience. This makes it very easy for anyone to 
            pick up a guitar and start learning their favorite songs! In this lesson we will cover the basics of guitar tabs and how to use them.
        </p>
        <div class="bodyHeader2"><h1>How Do Tabs Work?</h1></div>
        <p>Tabs work by targeting a specific string and a fret number. This allows the player to know where to position their fingers on the fret board.</p>
        <div class="img1"><img src="tabSnip.png" alt="snippet of guitar tab"></div>
        <p>The above image is a snippet of a guitar tab for the popular song "Sweet Home Alabama". Lets break this tab down and see how it works.
            First, you will notice on the left side there are 6 letters "e, b, g, d, a, and E". These represent your guitar strings. Just remember, the 
            big "E" string is the one at the top of your guitar when playing. Tabs are written inverted to how your strings are actully positioned. 
        </p>
        <p>So now lets talk about the numbers you see in the image. Each number on the tab represents the fret number on your fret board with the exception of "0".
            "0" will always represent an open string which means no fret is being pressed on. Each number you see represents that note struck once. You will notice the
            numbers are spaced out horizontally. This means each one of these notes acts as a single note and gets struck once by it's self. So for the example above, 
            you would play "0, 0, 3, 2, ect.". </p>
        <h3 class="img2Header">But what about numbers that are stacked together?</h3>
        <div class="img2"><img src="tabSnip2.png" alt="snippet of guitar tab for D chord"></div>
            <p>In the above example, you can see our fret numbers are all aligned vertically unlike in the previous example. This simply means
                these notes are being played together as one chord instead of individual notes. So instead of picking each individual note, you would play all of the 
                notes in one strum. </p>
        <div class="lastHeader"><h1>Putting It All Together!</h1></div>
        <p class="lastP">So now that we know what the letters and numbers are for, let's put it all together and play! Looking back to our first example, lets focus on
            the first note (0 on the D string). So we know we are targeting the D string and the note has a fret value of 0 so in this case we will
            pick the D string once without pressing down on any fret. For the 3rd note (3rd fret on B string), we will pick the B string once while pressing the 
            B string down at the 3rd fret. One draw back to using tabs vs traditional sheet music is that tabs can't really give you timing or rythem so it's best
            to be familiar with song you are trying to learn!
